A platform to build Bitcoin and blockchain-based applications for the next generation of financial technology. The decentralized nature of the Bitcoin network allows for highly resilient infrastructure.

## Getting Started

Install with Node.js

```bash
npm install bitcore
```

Install for web browsers:

```bash
bower install bitcore
```

Create a transaction:
```js
var bitcore = require('bitcore');
var transaction = new bitcore.Transaction();
var transaction.from(unspent).to(address, amount);
transaction.sign(privateKey);
```

Spin up a full node and join the network:

```bash
npm install -g bitcore-cli
bitcore create mynode
cd mynode
bitcore start
```

## Security

We're using Bitcore in production, as are [many others](http://bitcore.io#projects), but please use common sense when doing anything related to finances! We take no responsibility for your implementation decisions.

If you find a security issue, please email security@bitpay.com.

## Contributing

Please send pull requests for bug fixes, code optimization, and ideas for improvement. For more information on how to contribute, please refer to our [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/bitpay/bitcore/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) file.

## Building the Browser Bundle

To build bitcore full bundle for the browser:

```sh
gulp browser
```

This will generate files named `bitcore.js` and `bitcore.min.js`.

You can also use our pre-generated files, provided for each release along with a PGP signature by one of the project's maintainers. To get them, checkout a release commit (for example, https://github.com/bitpay/bitcore/commit/e33b6e3ba6a1e5830a079e02d949fce69ea33546 for v0.12.6).

To verify signatures, use the following PGP keys:
- @braydonf: https://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x9BBF07CAC07A276D
- @pnagurny: https://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0909B33F0AA53013

## Development & Tests

```sh
git clone https://github.com/bitpay/bitcore
cd bitcore
npm install
```

Run all the tests:

```sh
gulp test
```

You can also run just the Node.js tests with `gulp test:node`, just the browser tests with `gulp test:browser`
or create a test coverage report (you can open `coverage/lcov-report/index.html` to visualize it) with `gulp coverage`.
